# Roadmap 

- [ ] Port ray marching lab to QT (12.03.21)
	+ Rendering quad to screen 
	+ Add new vertex shader for quad 
	+ Implement fragment shader for raymarching 
	+ Handle uniform variables that ShaderToy uses 

- [ ] Basic mandelbulb renderer (12.08.21)
	+ Fixed camera (no transformations or anything fancy)
	+ Single light (phong illumination model)
	+ Basic coloring (maybe based on distance) 
	+ Implement (approximate) SDF for Mandelbulb (getting this right 
	  will probably be the hardest step)
	+ Implement normal computations for each point on Mandelbulb 
	+ ...Extra setup stuff that I'm probably neglecting 

- [ ] Intermediate mandelbulb renderer (12.11.21)
	+ Dynamic camera (akin to camera in Shapes assignment)
	+ Support for zooming + recomputations on zoom (maybe)
	+ Soft shadows 

- [ ] Advanced mandelbulb renderer (12.14.21)
	+ Ambient occlusion 
	+ Multiple lights
	+ Glass shader?

- [ ] Record video (12.14.21)
